## HTML edits

I reformatted the html file, primarily removing the <div> tags in favor the following semantic tags: header, nav, section, aside, and footer. 


## CSS edits

I tried my best to streamline the css by taking items with the same styling and putting them under a single css class or consolidating them in a list before the css rather than listing them out individually. For Example: 
```css
}
.benefit-lead, 
.benefit-brand, 
.benefit-cost {
    margin-bottom: 32px;
    color: #ffffff;
}
```
